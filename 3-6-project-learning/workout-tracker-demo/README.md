# Workout Tracker

This is the demo of a backend system for a workout application where a user can sign up, log in, create workout plans, and track their progress.

This demo is based off the [Workout Tracker](https://roadmap.sh/projects/fitness-workout-tracker) project by [roadmap.sh](https://www.roadmap.sh).
