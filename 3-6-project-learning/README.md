# WEEK 3 - 6

## WEEK 3

### Goals

This week aims to provide interns with an overview of the Spring framework with emphasis on its paradigms for RESTful architectures, including a persistence layer, service layer, and endpoints.

### Implementation

This week, I have gotten to building the demo of my Workout Tracker API, and while a lot of work remains to be done, I decided to come up with something very very basic that is within the scope of the deliverables and also shows what I intend to do over the next few weeks.

Check out [Workout Tracker Demo](https://github.com/islajr/fip-backend-path/tree/e5506950ce61e0a1a3f4479a518e24073d7de974/3-6-project-learning/workout-tracker-demo) to see how I created endpoints that return bare HTTP responses with hardcoded string values in the payload.
