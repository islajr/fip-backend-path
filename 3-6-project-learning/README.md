# WEEK 3 - 6

## WEEK 3

### Goals

This week aims to provide interns with an overview of the Spring framework with emphasis on its paradigms for RESTful architectures, including a persistence layer, service layer, and endpoints.

Interns are required to create a Spring Boot Application with atleast 4 endpoints.

### Implementation

This week, I have gotten to building the demo of my Workout Tracker API, and while a lot of work remains to be done, I decided to come up with something very very basic that is within the scope of the deliverables and also shows what I intend to do over the next few weeks.

Check out [Workout Tracker Demo](https://github.com/islajr/fip-backend-path/tree/e5506950ce61e0a1a3f4479a518e24073d7de974/3-6-project-learning/workout-tracker-demo) to see how I created endpoints that return bare HTTP responses with hardcoded string values in the payload.

## WEEK 4

### Goals

This week's lesson is for interns to gain an overview of ORM paradigms, implementing entity classes and repositories, persisting data, querying with JPQL/HQL etc.

Interns are required to use important Hibernate annotations to design a database entity with, at least, ten (10) fields.

### Implementation

Within the context of the [Workout Tracker Demo](https://github.com/islajr/fip-backend-path/tree/e5506950ce61e0a1a3f4479a518e24073d7de974/3-6-project-learning/workout-tracker-demo), I am presenting the [User](https://github.com/islajr/fip-backend-path/blob/997a035f79aeb1d66d33d20d92b9e4d686201278/3-6-project-learning/workout-tracker-demo/src/main/java/org/project/workouttrackerdemo/model/User.java) entity that defines the details of each user of the application.
