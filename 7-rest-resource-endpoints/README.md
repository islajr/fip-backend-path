# 7. Implementing REST Resource Endpoints

## Goals

This week's lesson aims to teach interns everything that goes into implementing REST resource endpoints, namely: declaring the endpoints, capturing parameters, returning respones from endpoints, service injections, handling errors, securing the endpoints, and providing a REST API specification.

Interns are required to create a spring boot application with at least four (4) endpoints, handle exception handling, validate input, and create a service, repository and controller layer.

## Implementation

To show my implementation of this, I am once again referring to [Workout Tracker Demo]() where various authentication endpoints have been exposed for registration, login, updating and deleting users.
