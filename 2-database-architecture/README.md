# 2. Database Architecture

## Goal

This module of the Flexisaf internship programme builds on the previous learning of DBMS and focuses on the architecture of the database.

Interns are also required to learn how to design a database schema on a high level in order to capture the entities and relationships involved in typical domains such as tables, keys and constraints.

## Implementation

Since this is a **lesson** module, the deliverable is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of a self-designed database schema. The link to the ERD will be provided, and further information, if any, will be added below.
