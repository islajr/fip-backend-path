# 2. Database Architecture

## Goal

This module of the Flexisaf internship programme builds on the previous learning of DBMS and focuses on the architecture of the database.

Interns are also required to learn how to design a database schema on a high level in order to capture the entities and relationships involved in typical domains such as tables, keys and constraints.

## Notes

An Entity Relationship diagram is a pictorial representation of data, describing the ways and manners in which data is communicated, and is related to one another.
This diagram characterizes objects, representing them with uniquely-identifiable shapes, and shows thew way these objects are supposed to interact, one with another.

Since this is a **lesson** module, the deliverable is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of a self-designed database schema. The link to the ERD will be provided, alongside any other necessary additionals.

## Implementation

To combat this task, I designed a schema and provided the ER Diagram of a Workout Tracker API that I intend to build over the course of this internship, which, if allowed, will also serve as my final deliverable project.

Workout Tracker is an application where users can sign up, log in, create workout plans, and track their progress towards a specified **goal**.

Attached within this [directory](./er-diagram) is the .png format of the ER Diagram built with [dbdiagram](https://www.dbdiagram.io)'s online builder tool.
